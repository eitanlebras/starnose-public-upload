See exactly what Claude Code is reading, thinking, and doing.
Every token, every skill load, every compaction event — live at the network layer.

```bash
# npm
npx snose on

# pip
pip install starnose && snose on
```

## commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `snose on` | start proxy daemon on :3399, set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` |
| `snose off` | stop daemon, clear env var |
| `snose status` | show running state, call count, session cost |
| `snose sense` | live feed — every call as it happens, loop detection, compaction alerts |
| `snose dig` | keyboard-driven inspector — expand any call, see token breakdown, search history |

Both `snose` and `starnose` work as binary names.

## how it works

Starnose is an HTTP proxy that sits between Claude Code and the Anthropic API.
One environment variable (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3399`), zero code changes.
Every request and response is recorded to a local SQLite database with full system prompt parsing,
skill token breakdown, compaction detection, and missing context tracking.

Nothing leaves your machine.
